description: A framework for creating detailed, accurate TV episode rankings by using head-to-head comparisons and running the Elo rating algorithm on the results to compute the best episodes and seasons. Best Episodes was used to create <a href="http://www.ratetheoffice.com">www.ratetheoffice.com</a> (over 17,000 votes processed within 24 hours of launch) and <a href="http://www.ratepsych.com">www.ratepsych.com</a> (over 5000 votes processed within 24 hours of launch). These are arguably the most accurate and comprehensive TV ratings on the web!
