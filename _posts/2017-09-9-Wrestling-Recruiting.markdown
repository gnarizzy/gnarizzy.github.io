description: Created for Well Run Tournaments, LLC, Wrestling Recruiting is designed to keep track of recruiter earnings using a Multi-level Marketing (MLM) approach. For example, a recruiter could earn 20% of generation 1 recruits (anyone he directly recruits to the gym), 10% of generation 2 recruits (anyone his recruits recruit to the gym), 5% of generation 3 recruits (anyone his recruits' recruits recruit to the gym), etc.). The software builds a directed acyclic graph (a tree) of recruiter-recruitee relationships, where each level of nodes represents a different generation of recruits. It then calculates the earnings for each month based on the user's specified payout levels for each generation.
