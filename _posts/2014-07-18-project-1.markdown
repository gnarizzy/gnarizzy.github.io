description: Circa is a platform for local buying and selling. It creates a hassle-free experience by handling payments, delivery, and returns. Cheaper than Amazon, safer than Craigslist! Circa was originally created by Gautam Narula and Andrew Schuster, co-founders (and Chief Donut Procurer and Chief Delivery Boy, respectively) of Centaurii, Inc. Now that Centaurii is defunct, Gautam (me) has open-sourced the code. Circa will remain in test mode at [www.usecirca.com](www.usecirca.com).
