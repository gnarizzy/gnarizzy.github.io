description: Created for Well Run Tournaments, LLC., Wrestling Ratings is full-fledged wrestling event management software. It features custom weight-adjusted Elo rating algorithm for ranking wrestlers, REST APIs for consumption by mobile apps, autocomplete search functionality, and payment processing for end users. It uses genetic algorithms to optimize the matchmaking algorithm for pairing wrestlers (using the weight-adjusted Elo rating as one of several inputs) in "arena" style tournaments, where participants are continously paired and added back to a participant pool once they have completed their match as opposed to a tournament with a fixed number of rounds.
