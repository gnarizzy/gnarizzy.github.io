description: Circa is a platform that removes the hassle from local buying and selling by handling payments, delivery, and returns. Cheaper than Amazon, safer than Craigslist! Circa was originally created by Gautam Narula and Andrew Schuster, co-founders of Centaurii, Inc. Now that Centaurii is defunct, the code has been <a href="https://github.com/gnarizzy/circa">open-sourced</a>. Circa will remain in test mode at <a href="http://www.usecirca.com">www.usecirca.com</a>.
